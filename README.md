# curate(ss)

curate(ss) is a web dashboard focused on bringing enriching, positive experiences centered around fine arts and creative expression, in a form that is accessible and engaging. 

Our goal is to bring a museum like experience to users throughout the day. Part of that experience is the unique perspective every visitor brings - works of art are interpreted by the viewer, so we wanted to take into account the environment around our user when styling the dashboard. 

The style will be adjusted based on the user's location and current weather, with additional features planned such as night/day shifts. 

We hope transport users with the dynamic visuals, but also provide information about the artist and painting to inform and educate them on the environment and perspective behind the painting itself. 

Thanks, we hope you enjoy your curated(ss) experience!
